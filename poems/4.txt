inhaling a particle of air
in the very top of his body
above the silent harpoon burned there by grim death
by a mere strip of canvas
light as you may fancy for lowering
large curved bones set upright
in different individuals these rates are different
but they are alike now

he has a hump on his frozen brow
before the wind rises

to settle down in my brief sleep
the ribs and terrors that cook with all his tattooings
spying out more line
his golden robe was rustling
soon it went this way

everyone knows what a fearfulness it would still be
