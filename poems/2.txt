looking over the bulwarks the mariners
morally enfeebled also by the tail
and the truest of all queequeg's peculiarities
the eternal honor of securing
my marriage
in a shroud

a whale is i a coffin for a spell
but god's great unflattering laureate nature
i remember the first assailant himself
not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel
his name i have here
the cheerful greenness of complete decay
spreads over her side
now that i think of death
how then if he cuts off one of the limbs?
lithe swayings -- coyings -- flutterings

the flesh perfectly healed around them
soon enrolled among the tombs
a lipless unfeatured blank
is in all things i could endure it but he's too far forward

had you descended from the open casements
ere nightfall
that night mingling their mumblings with his officers
this terrible event clothed in the archangel
all sure of its roots expands into two equal portions

the fourth morning a confused wrangling
you doubtless overheard a holy church

insensibly blend with them
take a fancy to be counted down in dollars

the world may be similarly shaped
the best of wives she is
drawing nigh to drowning
