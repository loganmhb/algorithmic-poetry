he has only harpooneers
long maintaining an enchanted air
no resolution could withstand

"i do glory in my wild wanderings.
no ship ever sailed out
to lay footpath bridges over small streams."

as it rolled five thousand years and no perspective
to report a fair moonlight
there they lay in his concluding

his uplifted eyes caught the blade

hand over hand upon the quarter deck
by holding them up

said the pale mate gloomily,
"i gave her to understand
there were two golden hoops--
oh busy weaver unseen weaver--
pause one word by night
on one breath only serving for two or three"
at the edges
preserve him
after gaining his own bloody nails in the desert
while in life
it remains to magnify him
