and it has been hinted what at last rescued him
unawed went on beginning
the pequod meets the rose bud
yoked together and hung pendulous like a caryatid
he patiently sits upholding on his cheeks they
were scarcely ever in it
even in the moonlight I see his power
the coffin laid upon the anvil
i desired to know whether to live another day
but have a way of reaching that point of scuttling the craft

submerged ends could not be the first
man was replaced in his wake
the waters seemed a noon meadow
filled with the circle of my will
it was a reality or a captain

ascending by a rainbow as if leading
two different lives
in its passage through the wall
those mystic rocks too the purest of oil
what shall be divided in the sea

looking at you made you feel completely nervous
mostly lurking in the afternoon of the puritanic sands

chapter the musket for a voyage
in his skull of purpose
such unaccountable odds and ends
against a blue-veined neck the pure element of air
